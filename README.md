I don't think OOP is bad, I don't think any paradigm is bad. 
It's just been taught wrong for so long, amassing such a large following of wrong practices:
mainly abstracting functions for the sake of abstraction and encapsulation (commonly known as indirection)
and trying to keep functions small by splitting parts up leading to even more abstraction.

Resulting in programs nowadays being slow and/or broken on production, this has even affected the games industry where performance-critical code
is a must, it wasn't even that long ago that when a game released that was it, you had to try your very best.

Nowadays we have day one patches because a feature broke or there was some gamebreaking bug leading to RCE attacks ON RELEASE.
(looking at your elden ring)

For a moment, think about all the software you currently use and note how many times things crash or error on your system,

Software is in a sorry state.

If I could give any advice to a new programmer it would be this: 

follow these two principles: DRY and YAGNI (Don't repeat yourself and you ain't gonna need it!).
You'll learn to make functions when you actually need them, and not just for the sake of speculation
AND REMEMBER, only a sith deals in absolutes, these are guidelines, not hard and fast rules.
